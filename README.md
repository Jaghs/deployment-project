# Loan Predictions & Deployment Project


### [Assignment](assignment.md)

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to build a loan predictor api that is stired in the cloud to handle predicitons on whether a loan will be approved or rejected based on a set of input features such as gender, marital status, credit history, etc. The application uses a machine learning model to make the prediction along with a pipeline. This provide a useful tool for individuals or organizations who need to evaluate loan applications. By automating the loan prediction process, the application can save time and resources and make the loan process more efficient.

## Hypothesis


## EDA 
(fill in what you discovered in your exploration of the dataset)


## Process
(fill in what you did during EDA, cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, deployment, testing)
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results/Demo
(fill in your model's performance, details about the API you created, and (optional) a link to an live demo)

## Challanges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time? are there any potential issues/biases with your model/use case?)
